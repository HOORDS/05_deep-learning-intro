# 05_deep-learning-intro

# Welcome !

* In this repo you will find the notebooks used in the presentation.  
* These are ipython notebooks and can be opened using either jupyter, google colab or your preferred interactive python platform.  


# Recommandations
* I recommand you opening them with google colab (simply click on the badge below); this will allow you to run them without having to install any libraries.
* During the presentation I highly recommand you coding from scratch. The code is fairly simple and easy to implement. Open a blank google colab presenation and code along !
